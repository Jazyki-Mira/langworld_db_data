This folder contains the **template of a feature profile** in XSLM format, and, separately, **code of VBA macros** included in this template for better version control.

Filename `_template.xlsm` begins with an underscore so that the template doesn't get lost when it's around files with filled feature profiles.

To edit a particular feature profile in Excel, one must **copy** the template into a file named with **ID of a doculect**, then open this new file and run a macro that downloads the data for this doculect from CSV in this GitHub repository.
