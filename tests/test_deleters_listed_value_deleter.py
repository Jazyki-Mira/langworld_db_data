# To my mind, this will probably be a structure isomorphic to adders
# It should be, first of all, able to delete a value from the inventory
# and subsequently update the IDs of reminiscent values
# Moreover, as was discussed earlier, it should not simply delete values but pop them
# so that the popped value will be available to insert somewhere else with ListedValueAdder
# How should the deleted values be changed in profiles? Should they become custom or not_stated?
# To me, it would be more logical to make them custom, again for the sake of possible movement
# However, perhaps both options may be necessary to provide
